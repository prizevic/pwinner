         <p>what was america before it was called america? </p>
         <h5>According to Journeyz, there is little evidence to show that America was called differently before its current name. Native Americans called themselves differently, but they never were united under one single name, identity, or even language. The interesting part about America is that we might not know too much about it before its discovery, but we know everything about it after its discovery. Many explorers and merchants made it here before the continent was even on the map. Columbus was the first explorer to discover America. He was looking for a new path towards Asia and he wasn’t sure or he had no proof of just the size of the continent he stumbled upon. But the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci also found America. The difference is that he wrote about his journeys frequently. European publications and word of mouth quickly traveled through his writing. This is why America was named after him and not Columbus. It was a German cartographer that adapted his name of Amerigo to the Latin version of America and this was the first map called Universalis Cosmographia of the world that also incorporated America under this name</h5>
